I received my MSc degree in Nuclear and Particle physics at Milano-Bicocca University. 
My background ranged from applied particle physics to environmental radioactivity
and high-energy physics. My work at the <a href="https://lena.unipv.it/en/the-reactor/">Triga Mark II nuclear fission reactor </a> in Pavia (Italy) 
lead my in contact with the ice core science world. 

I did my PhD and a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.iceandclimate.nbi.ku.dk/">Center for Ice and Climate</a> in 
Copenhagen (Denmark) working on Continuous Flow Analysis systems and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
for the detection of chemical tracers in ice cores for past sea ice reconstructions. 

From 2020 to 2022 I carried out a Marie Curie Fellowship at the University of Venice and University of Bergen with a project on
Artificial Intelligence techniques applied to ice core analyses <a href="www.icelearning.net">(ICELEARNING)</a>. 

From 2022 to 2023 I was PI of the <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/blog/2022-10-03-grants-icenet">ICENET</a>,
a pilot project on glacier modeling using deep neural networks, at the National Research Council (Institute of Polar Sciences), 
in collaboration with the University of California, Irvine. From 2023 I was granted another Marie Curie project, SKYNET, 
to calculate the ice volume of all the World's glaciers, using AI/ML, in collaboration with University of California 
Irvine and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
The result are in discussion in the Geophysical Model Development journal, the code is publicly 
available on <a href="https://github.com/nmaffe/iceboost">GitHub</a>.

I am particularly passionate about deep learning and tackling Earth System Science problems using AI/ML methodologies.
