This is Niccolo biography here2. 

You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header 
of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will 
render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to 
use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and
[Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. 
Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
